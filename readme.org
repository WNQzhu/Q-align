* Spherical Graph Embedding for Item Retrieval in Recommendation System

Source code for CIKM'22 paper(Short Paper Track) "Spherical Graph Embedding for Item Retrieval in Recommendation System".

** Introduction
In this paper, we present a simple and effective graph-based retrieval method. Internally, we call it Q-align, which has widely
deployed in many different scenarios(Item/User Retrieval, Graph Transfer Learning, diversity in recommender, etc).

The wide deployments of the proposed method show its effectiveness in real-life Recommendation Systems.

** Thanks
To evaluate our method on the public dataset, we use the CogDL Toolkit(https://cogdl.ai/).
The results are listed in "result.txt".
We're grateful to the authors of the CogDL Toolkit(https://codgl.ai) for their excellent work, which saves us much time.
